This version of pyspellcode has been hacked up to be used on the Stan Math library.

# pyspellcode
Python script for using `clang` and `hunspell` for spell checking source code comments.

This script parses the [AST dump](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html) output from `clang` and runs words found in comment nodes through `hunspell`. It's not perfect, but it's completely IDE independent. It just needs `clang` and `hunspell`. So it should be usable in continuous integration environments like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).

The script accepts command line arguments to fine tune what it does. These arguments are similar to what `clang` and `hunspell` use for doing things like setting which programming language standard to use or adding a personal dictionary file. Note that by default, not all comments are spell checked. Only documentation comments are checked. To check all comments (including regular, non-documentation comments), use the `--all-comments` flag (`-a` for short).

For the most up-to-date command line argument usage, run the script with the `--help` flag (`-h` for short). For example:

```
$ ./spell-check.py --help
```
usage: spell-check.py [-h] [-v] [-I <dir>] [-std=c++11] [-std=c99]
                      [-std=c++14] [-std=c++17] [-a] [-e]
                      [--show-file-progress] [-p <full-file-path>] [-c]
                      [-x <extra-argument-to-clang>]
                      filename [filename ...]

positional arguments:
  filename              filename to inspect

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         gets more verbose to aid with diagnostics
  -I <dir>, --include-dir <dir>
                        adds directory to include search path
  -std=c++11            selects the C++11 language standard
  -std=c99              selects the C99 language standard
  -std=c++14            selects the C++14 language standard
  -std=c++17            selects the C++17 language standard
  -a, --all-comments, -fparse-all-comments
                        results in checking all comments
  -e, -Werror, --error-exit
                        nonzero exit status for unrecognized words
  --show-file-progress  shows filenames and results even when no unrecognized
                        words
  -p <full-file-path>, --personal-dict <full-file-path>
                        specify the fullpath to a personal dictionary
  -c, --collect         output deduplicated list of unrecognized words
  -x <extra-argument-to-clang>, --extra-clang-arg <extra-argument-to-clang>
                        extra argument for clang
